                <p class="text">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                    p Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.<span class="dots"> ......</span><span class="moreText"> However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
                        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell. </span></p>

            <p class="text">Coronavirus is a deadly virus that has caused this generation’s world wide pandemic. It is important to take extra precautions to help protect yourself and prevent further spread of the said virus. 
                The disease is transmitted via aerosol thus making it easily infectious. It is important to wash or disinfect hands with alcohol every time because aerosol droplets could be retained on surfaces for a certain amount of time and that is one way of contracting and spreading the virus. One sneeze or cough contains a large amount of viral load and since the virus travels and targets the respiratory system it is important to wear a face mask at all times.   
                <span><b>Vaccines</b></span> are proved to be effective and has been used by the society for years; And as much as the symptoms of Coronavirus is almost the same as the normal flu, it still imposed a great deal of fatality. The only way to limit the severity of its symptoms is to be vaccinated.
                Symptoms of this virus can be controlled but it is dependent on many factors and one of it being an individual’s immune system. That is why it is very important to consider the said steps in preventing the spread of Coronavirus. </span></p>

                    <h1>How Covid 19 <span>Vaccine</span> works?</h1>
                        <p>COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness.</p>
                        <p>Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.
                            COVID vaccine.It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Therefore, it is possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection.
                            Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are signs that the body is building immunity. Talk to a doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin (only for people age 18 or older), or antihistamines for any pain and discomfort experienced after getting vaccinated.</p>

                        <h1><span>01 </span>How do vaccines prevent disease?</h1>
                        <p>Vaccines mimic the virus or bacteria that causes disease and triggers the body’s creation of antibodies. These antibodies will provide protection once a person is infected with the actual disease-causing virus or bacteria.</p>
                        <h1><span>02 </span>How do vaccines differ?</h1>
                        <p>Vaccines differ in their composition and how they trigger the immune response to create antibodies. These antibodies protect the body from microorganisms and serve as protection once a person gets infected with disease. Vaccines can be inactivated, weakened or killed copies of the whole or part of the virus or bacteria, or genetic product (like mRNA vaccines) that creates protein copies without causing disease.</p>
                        <h1><span>03 </span> Why do we need to get vaccinated for COVID-19?</h1>
                        <p>vaccination is an important way to protect yourself from getting severe COVID-19.</p>
